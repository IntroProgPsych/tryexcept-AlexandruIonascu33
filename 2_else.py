# Exercise 2: Using else after a successful try
# ---------------------------------------------
# Ask the user to type a number and convert it to an integer.
# If the conversion succeeds, print "Conversion successful!" inside the else block.
# If it fails, catch the error and display a message.
# Always print "Attempt finished." in the finally block.

# Sample Input:
# Enter an integer: 42
#
# Sample Output:
# Conversion successful!
# Attempt finished.
#
# Sample Input (Error):
# Enter an integer: hello
#
# Sample Output:
# Error: That is not an integer.
# Attempt finished.
